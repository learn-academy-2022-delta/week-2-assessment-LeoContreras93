# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: a special variable that belongs to the function is called a parameter, and and argument is the information passed into a function where it is invoked.

  Researched answer: When you create a function, parameters are variables listed as a part of the function. and arguments are information or values passed into the function when it is invoked.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: iterates over each element in an array and returns a new array that has the same length. a short cut version of a for loop.

  Researched answer: .map has three built in parameters, it requires one argument value. 1st one is the value of the array at the current iteration, 2. the index of the array at the current iteration and 3. the array the high order function was called on, 2nd and 3rd are optional.



3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer:iterates over each element in an array and returns a new array that has the same length. a short cut version of a for loop and .filter will remove what we don't want and only keep what we do wan't also returns a subset of the array and has a built in if statement

  Researched answer: .map will do something to each element in the array of the same length and .filter will make decisions about each item in an array and return a subset based on the conditions given to it



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: functions indicate action and the return is your output, functions are reusable. no other data affects the function called due to encapsulation which is information inside the curly brackets. method is a function(behavior) that belongs to an object or built in methods.

  Researched answer: Functions can be customized, the input is a special variable that belongs to the function which is called a parameter. you can add logic and additional parameters seperated by commas. a function within an object is reffered to as a method which now that I think of it seem to be the exact samething but under different scenarios.


5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: destructuring is defining a pathway through a nested object.

  Researched answer:in an object you can take a variable and assign two variables to it with different values and you're able to take those values into individual variables and invoke them by recalling the variable.
  

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: I have no idea.

  Researched answer: it is a javascript behavior of moving the declarations to the top allowing a variable to be used before its been declared



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: inherits all methods from another class and uses the extend keyword to create a child class of another class(parent) like having  a main class then a sub class if that makes sense.

2. React: is a javascript library that allows your to create guide user interfaces. its also used to build online webpages, mobile webpages as well as mobile applications

3. React state: is like a classs that stores data and allows it to be managed and is able to be updated allowing a user interface to change.

4. React lifecycle methods: each component in React is made up of 3 phases which are mounting, updating and unmounting.
mounting is a made up of four built in methods, updating has 5 built in methods and unmounting has only one built in method.

5. DOM: stands for Document Object Model and it reacts by changing the way things look where the cursor is positioned allowing web apps to see the interactions and respond to them.
